# Hello, I'm Will
Here you will find a collection of projects and certifications I have been working on to showcase my skills.
Each project is designed to highlight different aspects of security I am proficient in and more will be added as I go along. 
With expertise in technology I am eager to take on challenges and contribute to the field.
