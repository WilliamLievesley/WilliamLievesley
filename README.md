# Hello, I'm Will, and Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio!
I'm an IT professional with experience in IT training and second-line service desk support, and I’m currently expanding into cybersecurity to transition into a SOC Analyst or ICT Security Analyst role. This portfolio reflects my journey as I build the skills and certifications needed to pursue that path.

With certifications such as ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC), and the Google Professional Cybersecurity Certificate, I’m focused on gaining the knowledge and hands-on experience necessary to protect organizations from evolving cyber threats.

Take a look around to explore my certifications, ongoing projects, and skills. I’m always open to new connections and opportunities to learn and grow. Thank you for visiting!
