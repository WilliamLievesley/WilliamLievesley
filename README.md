I'm an IT professional with experience in IT training and second-line service desk support, and Iâ€™m currently expanding into cybersecurity to transition into a SOC Analyst or ICT Security Analyst role. This portfolio reflects my journey as I build the skills and certifications needed to pursue that path.
